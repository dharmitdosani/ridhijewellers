This project is the development of an API for a micro e-commerce. 

PHP is used as the scripting language and MySQL as the database.

A XAMPP server needs to be set up before hitting any of the APIs. 

Steps to use the API:

1. Install the latest version of XAMPP and start the XAMPP server.

2. Import test_ridhi_jewellers.sql file into the phpmyadmin console.

3. Make necessary name changes.

4. Install Postman from https://www.getpostman.com/

5. There you go, you can now use all the services.
